## Useful commands

### Log
`git log --oneline --graph --decorate`

View the log in a useful and concise way

### Branch
`git checkout -b branch-name-goes-here`

Create a new branch from current branch

`git checkout branch-name`

Checkout the code of existing branch

`git checkout -`

Checkout previous branch 

### Rebase
`git rebase main`

Rebase current branch against main

`git rebase --abort`

Abort current rebase in progress and revert to the state before rebase

`git rebase --continue`

After resolving merge conflicts during a rebase, continue with rebasing.

`git rebase -i HEAD~3`

Enter into interactive rebase mode with top 3 commits in current branch. This is how you squash/reword/discard commits in local branch.

### Push

`git push origin HEAD`

Push the current branch to remote (the command will auto create remote ref if it doesn't exist)

`git push origin HEAD --force-with-lease`

Force push current branch to remote but don't override remote if someone else's changes are there. Need to do this after rebase, amend or anything that rewrites history

### Commit
`git commit --amend --no-edit`

Amend the last commit (HEAD) with new changes. This will rewrite history so you will have to force push after this.

`git commit --amend -m "new desc"`

Amend the last commit (HEAD) with a new commit message. This will rewrite history so you will have to force push after this.

### Stash

`git stash save`

Save all current tracked (staged and unstaged) files to stash. If you want to stash an untracked file (newly created file).

`git stash save stash-name-goes-here`

Save to stash with a descriptive name

`git stash apply n`

Apply a particular stash index (0-n)

### Reset

`git reset --hard origin/main`

Reset current branch to the state of remote main

`git reset --mixed HEAD~2`

Pop the last two commits in the current branch but preserve the changes from those commits in the staging area

`git checkout .`

Discard all tracked local changes. Untracked files (newly created files) won't be affected.

### Cherry Pick

`git cherry-pick commit-hash`

Cherry pick that commit and apply it to current branch

`git cherry-pick commit-hash commit-hash`

Cherry pick all listed commits and apply it on current branch

## Merge Strategies

### Rebasing

**Step 1:** Make sure you don't have any merge commits in your current branch. If you do, please don't rebase or you'll have a hard time resolving conflicts repeatedly.

**Step 2:** Make sure you don't have any uncommitted local changes. If you do, stash or commit them.

**Step 3:** (from current branch) `git checkout main`

**Step 4:** `git pull`  (This will fetch latest from origin/main and auto merge to local main. `pull` is just a shorthand for `fetch` and fast-forward `merge`)

**Step 5:** `git checkout -` (This will take you back to your previous branch)

**Step 6:** `git rebase main`

(If you run into conflicts you will need to resolve it manually and stage the changes)

**Step 7:** (once you stage the changes after resolving conflicts) `git rebase --continue`

**Step 8:** Voila! You've now successfully rebased your branch against main.

Please note that after every rebase, your branch commit hashes get revised. So you will need to force push your branch to remote using `git push origin HEAD --force-with-leash` to let git know that this is intentional. If you don't use `--force-with-leash` your push will fail.

(If you need to cancel your rebase at any point and revert to old state, you can always run `git rebase --abort` to do that)
